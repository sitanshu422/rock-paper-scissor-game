Winning Rules as follows :

paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.

#   In the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, two opponents randomly toss
 out hand gestures, and each one wins, loses or draws with equal 
probability. It's supposed to be a game of pure luck, not skill â€” and indeed,
 if humans were able to be perfectly random, no one could gain an upper hand 
over anyone else
